Description: Simply, this package is a collection of R tools that I find useful no matter the 
	project I am working on. They live in this package. I doubt that this repository will 
	be useful for anyone other then me, however. Still, this makes it easy to use devtools 
	to download and install the package into the conda environment that the package is 
	based out of.
